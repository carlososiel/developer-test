# Developer test
The purpose of these repository is to know the level of developers in Angular 2+ and NodeJS.

The problem to solve is a management of books into a library. The applications must allowed:

1. Create, update and delete a book entry.
2. Create, update and delete a category entry.
3. Create, update and delete a author entry.
4. List books by category and author.

Angular
-------
Make an angular application using `angular/cli`, the application should have these features:

1. CRUD for books (create, update, delete and list)
2. CRUD for category (create, update, delete and list)
3. CRUD for author (create, update, delete and list)
4. Allow to select author in book creation from an existent list.
5. Allow to select category in book creation from an existent list.
6. Use a separate module instead of default angular module.
7. The autor name should be showed as `Last Name, First Name`.
8. Use HTTP request to access the REST API.
9. Use a CSS library to make some styles, using Angular Material components is a plus.

NodeJS
------
Make an application using a HapiJS or Express that allow:

1. CRUD for books using REST API.
2. CRUD for author using REST API.
3. CRUD for category using REST API.
4. Validate request parameters.
5. Using MongoDB database to store data.

Plus
----
Exist some kinds that are a plus in evaluation, they are:

1. Using Angular Style guidelines.
2. Optimize code.
3. Use less third part libraries as possible.
4. Correct use of git.
5. Implement test to testing the features.
6. Using docker to run applications.

### How to work
Make a fork from these repository and when the test are completed, make a PR to these repository.
